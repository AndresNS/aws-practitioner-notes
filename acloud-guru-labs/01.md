# Managing AWS IAM User Permissions Using Groups and Policies

## Introduction

In this hands-on lab scenario, you are a security engineer working for a new startup that's launching an online bookstore for rare and antique books. The founder, Kia, needs your help with setting up her development team with the proper access permissions. In order to provide access and ensure the proper security measures are in place, you will use AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM). You will group users and assign permissions for the developer group using policies.

## Solution

Log in to the live AWS environment using the credentials provided. Make sure you're in the N. Virginia (`us-east-1`) region throughout the lab.
